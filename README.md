# Swifty-Words
- To Do: create gif/video

# Description
In this project I created a game that reads in 7 questions and answers. The answers are split into string bits and the user must find the answer using the bits that correspond to the questions. Once all answers are correctly sumbitted, a new level is loaded.

# Learned
- Change height of text field by removing borders
- Used Tag on UIButton to get all the buttons to have an Outlet (put in an array) & IBAction (using addTarget method)
- Reading from text file using Bundle, componentsSeperatedBy
- Randomized letter bits using GameplayKit
- Used enumerated() to get index element of array in a for loop
- String methods : replaceOccurencesOf - to get rid of the pipe symbols, trimmingCharacters - to get rid of the extra newline and whitespace symbols
- Used half open range operator
- Property observers to change the score label whenever the score was incremented
- Added extra funcitonality of decrementing the score if incorrect answer was given
